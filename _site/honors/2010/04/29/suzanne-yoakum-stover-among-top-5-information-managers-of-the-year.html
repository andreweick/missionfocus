  <h1>Suzanne Yoakum-Stover Among Top 5 Information Managers of the Year</h1>
  <h3>Andrew M. Eick</h3>
  <h5>April 29, 2010</h5>
    <p>The Institute for Modern Intelligence (IMI) announced  today that Dr. Suzanne Yoakum-Stover, IMI Executive Director, was named  as one of the top 5 information managers of the year by Information  Management Magazine.</p>

<p>Dr. Yoakum-Stover was recognized for her work creating a practical,  Ultra-Large Scale (ULS) systems solution – a unified dataspace - for  data storage, exploration, enrichment, and exploitation that  accommodates the diversity of data, semantics, and perspectives without  information loss or distortion. Through an innovation that provides a  generic interface to all data, she aims to enable all manner of processing to be put into production coherently within an internet-scale dataspace. Building upon this foundation her mission is to execute a  broad ULS systems research agenda with specific application to  intelligence and ultimately inaugurate what she terms &quot;the new  discipline of Modern Intelligence&quot; - the science and practice of  intelligence at Ultra-Large Scale.  &quot;I was absolutely delighted to be identified as one of the top  information managers of the year. It is an honor that reflects the community&#39;s recognition and growing acceptance of the IMI’s breakthrough  approach for addressing the scale and diversity of data storage,  processing, visualization, and management all within a unified, yet  completely open dataspace.&quot; - Dr. Yoakum-Stover.</p>
