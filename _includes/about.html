     We work in the Intelligence arena with DoD and IC customers alongside the <a href="http://imintel.org">Institute for Modern Intelligence</a>. Our core domain is the storage, processing, and use of data of immense scale and diversity. We are experts in cloud computing and storage technology. We are the creators of the Sign Representation Framework: the under-pinning of a game-changing approach to data unification. We believe the code we are writing will <em>change the world</em>.
